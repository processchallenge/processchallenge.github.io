                We received exceptional interest in our challenge and were thrilled to successfully complete it and publish the top-performing teams' work. We would like to extend our sincere thanks to the 37+ teams who took part. We are pleased to announce that additional data will be released soon as part of a new challenge at an upcoming international conference. Further details will be shared in due course.
